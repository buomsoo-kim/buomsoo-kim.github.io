First presedential candidate to discuss AI extensively as part of his platform

- Department: new executive department (the Department of Technology)
- Focus on AI
- Companies: create a public-private partnership 

## American AI Initiative

In Feb 2019, the president signed Executive Order 13859 announcing the __*American AI Initiative*__

- Investment in long-term research
- Support research in academia and industry
- Access to federal data
- Promote STEM education
- Develop AI in "a manner consistent with our Nation's values, policies, and priorities"
- AI must also be developed in a way that does not compromise our American values, civil liberties, or freedoms.

## Ethics of recommender systems

Most of the recommender systems used by large tech companies such as [*FAANG*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/faang-stocks.asp) use DL. There should be some effort to inform public/government about the details in the system.
