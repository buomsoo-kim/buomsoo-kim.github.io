# Using Dark Theme in Google Colaboratory

</p>

Recently, it was annoucned via the Google Colab twitter that the dark theme is supported in Colaboratory.

This was a great news for me who sometimes spent hours a day writing codes to process and analyze data with colaboratory. 

If you haven't tried it, try using it after reading this short article. It is sooo EASY and makes your eyes much less like burning.

## 1. Default (light) theme in Colaboratory

By default, the light theme is applied when you create a new colab file like below. 

<p align = "center">
<img src ="/data/images/2019-05-17/1.PNG" width = "600px"/>
</p>

But sometimes, working with a bright screen makes your eyes fatigued.

## 2. Converting to dark theme

### 1. Open "Preferences"

Click [Preferences] under [Tools] to manage your preferences. 

<p align = "center">
<img src ="/data/images/2019-05-17/2.PNG" width = "600px"/>
</p>

### 2. Change your theme

Change the theme to "dark." It will be set to "light" by default and you can always come back and change to the default seting of "light."

<p align = "center">
<img src ="/data/images/2019-05-17/3.PNG" width = "600px"/>
</p>


### 3. Start coding with less burden on your eyes!

Now come back to the colab file and you will see that the cells and background are changed into dark colors.

<p align = "center">
<img src ="/data/images/2019-05-17/4.PNG" width = "600px"/>
</p>


As noted, you can always bounce back to the default (light) mode same way. As always, thank you and enjoy coding!
