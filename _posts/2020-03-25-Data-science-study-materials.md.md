# Data science study resources
*Updated March 20, 2021*

As the field matures, there is an abundance of resources to study data science nowadays. At the same time, it is getting more difficult to search and locate high-quality study material with an increasing level of information overload. Therefore, I started gathering and organizing study resources for contemporary data science. Here, I present study materials that I highly recommend. Most materials are either (1) ones that I have personally studied and reviewed or (2) ones repeated recommended by my colleagues and friends. Hence, this is not a comprehensive set of resources for studying data science for anyone, but rather a curated set of materials from my (biased) point of view. Also, I will update and refresh the resources from time to time, so stay tuned!


## How to use resources in this page

Though this is a personally curated list of resources, it is **A LOT**. I do not expect anyone, including me, to be familiar with all materials and topics that are covered in this list. However, what I recommend is try out as many as relevant materials that you can before you embark your journey to a specific field of data science. I do not want to specifically regard one material better than another since it is a matter of taste. In the reinforcement learning terminology, you will need to *explore* a bit before you find a satisficing material for your studying. And this list will help you *exploring* while saving your most valuable resource, *time*. Come back to this list whenever you need to search for a new material that can guide your journey.
