# Google Colaboratory (Google Colab)

**Google Colab** is a free development tool for machine learning research and education.
It is based on Jupyter but does not require installation of Jupyter, or even Python on your machine!
You just need Google ID to use Google Colab service.

# Reasons why you should use Google Colab

To be honest, I was pretty skeptical on using Google Colab for machine learning development when I initially learned about it. Actually, it was almost a year ago and Colab did not have most of great benefits that they are providing now. Such benefits include:

* **Easy**
As it is based on Jupyter, creating and coding with Colab is basically similar to doing so with Jupyter Notebook. Though you will need to get used to some technicalities, such as uploading a file or connecting to Google Drive, but they will pay off with great convenience shortly after you get familiar.

* **Free**
It is free to use and you can also use free GPU (NVIDIA Tesla K80) up to 12 consecutive hours!
Training deep learning models with Colab is much faster than with my machine (with NVIDIA GTX 1060).

* **Accessible**
As long as you are connected to Internet and have Google ID, you can virtually use Google Colab anywhere, with any device. As mentioned, you do not need to install Python nor Jupyter, and also

* **Social**
As the name suggests, Google Colab is suited for collaborating with others. You can create and modify a Colab file with Google Drive, and as the file is automatically saved in your Google Drive, the file can be shared to your friends by sending only the Google Drive link to your file.

# Google Colab 101



Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

### Built on Poole

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Lanyon here) includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Lanyon features

In addition to the features of Poole, Lanyon adds the following:

* Toggleable sliding sidebar (built with only CSS) via **â˜°** link in top corner
* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Lanyon is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
