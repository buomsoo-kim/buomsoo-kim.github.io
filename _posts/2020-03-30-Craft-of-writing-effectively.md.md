# About the speaker

[Lawrence McEnerney](https://www.warrior-scholar.org/larry-mcenerney) is the Director of Writing Programs at the University of Chicago. Besides teaching students how to write and speak, he serves as Resident Master and consulted numerous clients such as universities, institues, and businesses on effective communication.

Below is the summarization of his talk on the craft of writing.

# Think about readers when writing

This is the gist of this talk.
Do not think of *rules* when writing. *Think about readers* if you are an expert caring about the value of your writing.

# (In many cases) Reading and writing processes are orthogonal

## Horizontal process of writing interferes vertical process of reading

- Horizontal process of writing: In most cases, writers use the writing process to help themselves think and make sense of the world.
- Vertical process of reading: Readers use the text to change the way they think about the world.

As a result, the writing process interferes with the reading process of readers.

## When readers are interfered,

They slow down or re-read.

Then, they misunderstand.

Then, they are aggravated.

Then, they are done with Reading.

## Teachers do not stop reading because they are paid to care about you

They are paid to read and grade your text, not to change the way they see the world.

</p>

Nevertheless, in the world beyond school, people are not paid to care about you. They read because the material has __*VALUE*__ to them.


# Your writing has to be VALUABLE

## Desiderata of professional text

- Clear
- Organized
- Persuasive
- **VALUABLE**

## Value is in the eye of the reader

Value does not lie in the "world." It lies in the mind of *readers*.

## Don't try to make readers understand, change their ideas

When people do not recognize the importance of work, many try to explain. But DO NOT EXPLAIN.

Teachers explain for the purpose of demonstrating.

Explaining is "revealing to the world what is inside your head. No one cares inside of your head!"

Writing is not about communicating your ideas to readers. It is about changing their ideas.

You explain only inside VALUABLE AND PURSUASIVE.


# How to make your writing valuable

## New and Original are not necessarily knowledge

- new? original? NO

- Who cares?

## Positivistic view of knowledge

The more, the better. The newer, the better

## Alternate view of knowledge

People interact and reach a consensus on what knowledge is (and isn't). So you have to deal with what *we* say what knowledge is (and isn't).

## Learning the CODE

__*Identify people with power in the community, and give them what they want*__

- Evey community has its own "code" that is shared across its members.

- Persuasion depends on what readers doubt. You have to know about the readers, i.e., the CODE.

- To get a paper published, you have to criticize previous work in accordance with the CODE.

*"You are great. You advanced our community in fabulous ways. But... (argument)"*

- Examples of vocabularies indicating community/code: widely, accepted, reported

- Spend 15 mins week, take articles in your field and print them out. Circle every word in the article that's making value.
