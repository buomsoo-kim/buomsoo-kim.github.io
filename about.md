# About

Hello! my name is Buomsoo (Conor) Kim. 
I am Research Associate / Ph.D. student at <a href = "https://www.insiteua.org" target="_blank"> INSITE: Center for Business Intelligence and Analytics </a> at Eller College of Management, University of Arizona. I have received BS at College of Business Administration, Seoul National University and MS at Graduate School of Business, Seoul National University.

My interests include, but are not limited to:
* ```Deep Learning```
* ```Reinforcement Learning```
* ```Data Visualization```
* ```Web```

The aim of this web page is to organize and share my works from research, lectures, and projects. **Anyone is welcome to use and contribute to materials exhibited in this page. **

Also, I am an avid reader of (Evolutionary) Biology and Philosophy. My favorite authors are Richard Dawkins and Karl R. Popper.

The method of science is the method of bold conjectures and ingenious and severe attempts to refute them. - Karl R. Popper (from Objective Knowledge - An Evolutionary Approach)
