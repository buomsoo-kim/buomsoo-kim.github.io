Hello there!

<p class="message">
Welcome To My Webpage!
</p>

Hello, my name is Buomsoo (Conor) Kim. 
I am Research Associate / Ph.D. student at <a href = "https://www.insiteua.org" target="_blank"> INSITE: Center for Business Intelligence and Analytics </a> at Eller College of Management, University of Arizona.

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
